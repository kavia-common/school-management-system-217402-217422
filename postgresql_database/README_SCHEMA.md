# PostgreSQL Schema (School Management System)

This container includes a normalized demo schema + seed dataset for local development/tests.

## What’s included

- Users / Roles / Permissions (RBAC)
- Students, Teachers
- Classes / Sections, Subjects, Teacher assignments
- Enrollments (per academic year)
- Attendance
- Exams, schedules, results
- Fees: structures, invoices, payments
- Timetable
- Notices (+ audience targeting)
- Audit log + sessions

All tables include foreign keys, cascades, and indexes suitable for demo usage.

## Apply schema + seed

1) Start the database:

```bash
cd postgresql_database
./startup.sh
```

2) Apply schema + seed:

```bash
cd postgresql_database
chmod +x apply_schema.sh
./apply_schema.sh
```

`apply_schema.sh` reads the connection string from `db_connection.txt` (generated by `startup.sh`) and runs `schema_and_seed.sql`.

## Notes

- `password_hash` values are demo placeholders (not secure). Real backend code should store strong password hashes (bcrypt/argon2).
- The script drops and recreates tables (safe for local demos).
- Seed academic year used: `2025-2026`.
